The :term:`solver`\ s that provide sampling for a :term:`binary quadratic model` 
problem, such as an Advantage quantum computer, or a quantum-classical hybrid 
:term:`sampler`, such as Leap's :class:`~dwave.system.samplers.LeapHybridCQMSampler`
hybrid constrained quadratic model (CQM) sampler, are typically remote resources. 
The D-Wave Cloud Client :class:`~dwave.cloud.client.Client` class manages such 
remote solver resources.

Preferred use is with a context manager---a :code:`with Client.from_config(...) as`
construct---to ensure proper closure of all resources. The following example snippet
creates a client based on an auto-detected configuration file and instantiates
a solver.

>>> with Client.from_config() as client:   # doctest: +SKIP
...     solver = client.get_solver(num_qubits__gt=5000)

Alternatively, the following example snippet creates a client for hybrid resources
that it later explicitly closes.

>>> client = Client.from_config(client="hybrid")   # doctest: +SKIP
>>> # code that uses client
>>> client.close()    # doctest: +SKIP

Typically you use the :class:`~dwave.cloud.client.Client` class. You can also 
instantiate specialized QPU, hybrid, and CPU clients directly.
