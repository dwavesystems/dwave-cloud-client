==================
dwave-cloud-client
==================

D-Wave Cloud Client is a minimal implementation of the REST interface used to
communicate with D-Wave Sampler API (SAPI) servers.

SAPI is an application layer built to provide resource discovery, permissions,
and scheduling for quantum annealing resources at D-Wave Systems.
This package provides a minimal Python interface to that layer without
compromising the quality of interactions and workflow.

The example below instantiates a D-Wave Cloud Client and solver based on the local
system's auto-detected default configuration file and samples a random Ising problem
tailored to fit the solver's graph.

.. code-block:: python

    import random
    from dwave.cloud import Client

    # Connect using the default or environment connection information
    with Client.from_config() as client:

        # Load the default solver
        solver = client.get_solver()

        # Build a random Ising model to exactly fit the graph the solver supports
        linear = {index: random.choice([-1, 1]) for index in solver.nodes}
        quad = {key: random.choice([-1, 1]) for key in solver.undirected_edges}

        # Send the problem for sampling, include solver-specific parameter 'num_reads'
        computation = solver.sample_ising(linear, quad, num_reads=100)

        # Print the first sample out of a hundred
        print(computation.samples[0])
