    Workaround for SAPI returning invalid v3 solver representation of problems
    submitted using v2 representation (with Ocean < 9).
    When ``Client.retrieve_answer()`` receives a solver identity with ``graph_id``
    missing, we fall back to a partial solver match (based on name only).
    See `#727 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client/issues/727>`_.
