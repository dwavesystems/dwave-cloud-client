    Enable the previous client close behavior to wait for all remote jobs to finish.

    Waiting for all jobs to finish and their results to be downloaded before
    shutting down the client is now the new default. To close the client as
    fast as possible (immediately preventing status polls and answer downloads),
    set the ``wait`` argument to false: ``Client.close(wait=False)``.

    See `#712 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client/issues/712>`_.
