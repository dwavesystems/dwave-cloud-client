    Add support for Leap deprecation messages to ``dwave.cloud.client.Client``
    and ``dwave.cloud.api.client.DWaveAPIClient``.

    Deprecation messages received are raised as Python warnings using a new category,
    ``dwave.cloud.api.exceptions.ResourceDeprecationWarning`` and logged using the
    ``WARNING`` log level.

    See `#721 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client/issues/721>`_.
