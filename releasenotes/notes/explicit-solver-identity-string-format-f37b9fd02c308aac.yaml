    Make ``SolverIdentity`` string representation more explicit. Version
    components are now clearly identified, avoiding ambiguity and enabling
    reverse lookups (i.e. conversion between string representation and solver
    identity structure).

    Add ``SolverIdentity.from_id()`` factory that creates solver identity model
    off its string representation.

    See `#713 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client/issues/713>`_.
