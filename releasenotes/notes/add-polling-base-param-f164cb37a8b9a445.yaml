features:
  - |
    Add ``poll_backoff_base`` configuration option to control the exponential
    base of the (problem status) polling schedule. Available as a config file
    option and ``dwave.cloud.Client`` keyword argument.
upgrade:
  - |
    Make polling schedule denser in the beginning (by lowering the exponential
    base from ``2`` to ``1.3``), thus enabling much faster answer download for
    SAPI response times under two minutes.
