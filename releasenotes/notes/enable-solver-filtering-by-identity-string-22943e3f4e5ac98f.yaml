    Allow ``solver`` to be specified using the new solver identity string
    representation.

    The new format is supported in a config file::

      [my-experiment]
      solver = Advantage_system6.4;graph_id=01dae5a273

    environment variable::

      DWAVE_API_SOLVER='Advantage_system6.4;graph_id=01dae5a273'

    as an argument to the ``dwave`` CLI::

      dwave solvers -s 'Advantage_system6.4;graph_id=01dae5a273'

    or as the client constructor argument:

      from dwave.cloud import Client

      with Client.from_config(solver='Advantage_system6.4;graph_id=01dae5a273') as client:
        solver = client.get_solver()

        assert(solver.name == 'Advantage_system6.4')
        assert(solver.graph_id == '01dae5a273')

    Note: specifying your solver via name only is still possible. In that case,
    working graph version is not constrained.

    See `#714 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client/issues/714>`_.
